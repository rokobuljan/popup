# popup
A simple jQuery modal popup window

The popup appears centered in viewport and features a flexible scrollable Content and a top fixed Header.

Call the popup using `data-popup="#popup-content-id"` on any element.
If you want to manually show the popup via JS it's easy as `popup("#popup-content-id")`
